Feature: Installing OpenClaw Skill
  As a developer using OpenClaw for SDLC automation
  I want a skill that installs the OpenClaw running-sdlc skill
  So that I can deploy the latest orchestration skill without manual file copying

  Scenario: Skill files are installed locally
    Given I invoke "/installing-openclaw-skill"
    When the skill completes
    Then the running-sdlc skill is copied to "~/.openclaw/skills/running-sdlc/"

  Scenario: Gateway is restarted
    Given skill files are installed
    When installation completes
    Then the OpenClaw gateway is restarted

  Scenario: CLI hang patch is applied
    Given the openclaw CLI has the message send hang bug
    When the skill runs
    Then it automatically runs the patch script to fix the hang issue

  Scenario: Standalone installer supports link mode
    Given I run "install-openclaw-skill.sh --link"
    When the script completes
    Then the skill directory is symlinked instead of copied
