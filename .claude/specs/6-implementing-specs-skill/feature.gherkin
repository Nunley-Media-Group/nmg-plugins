Feature: Implementing Specs Skill
  As a developer with completed specs
  I want a skill that reads specs and executes tasks sequentially
  So that I can implement features methodically following the spec-defined task order

  # --- Happy Path ---

  Scenario: Specs are read before implementation
    Given I invoke "/implementing-specs" with a feature name
    When the skill starts
    Then it reads all spec files from ".claude/specs/{feature-name}/" before any code changes

  Scenario: Plan mode gets approval before coding
    Given specs have been read in interactive mode
    When the skill enters plan mode
    Then the implementation plan is presented for user approval before any code is written

  Scenario: Tasks execute sequentially
    Given the implementation plan is approved
    When implementation begins
    Then tasks from the tasks spec are executed in order, one at a time

  # --- Bug Fix ---

  Scenario: Bug fixes follow fix strategy
    Given the spec is for a bug fix
    When implementation begins
    Then the skill follows the fix strategy precisely
    And it minimizes change scope
    And it includes a regression test

  # --- Automation Mode ---

  Scenario: Automation mode skips plan approval
    Given automation mode is active
    When the skill runs
    Then plan mode is skipped
    And tasks execute without approval gates
