Feature: Installing Locally Skill
  As a plugin developer or user
  I want a one-command skill that installs all marketplace plugins locally
  So that I can use or test the latest plugin versions without manual copying

  Scenario: All marketplace plugins are installed
    Given I invoke "/installing-locally" in the nmg-plugins repo
    When the skill completes
    Then all plugins listed in marketplace.json are installed to "~/.claude/plugins/"

  Scenario: Skills, hooks, and agents are copied
    Given a plugin has skills, hooks, and agents
    When installation runs
    Then all skill directories, hook configurations, and agent definitions are copied

  Scenario: OpenClaw skill is synced
    Given the OpenClaw running-sdlc skill exists in the repo
    When "/installing-locally" runs
    Then the skill is synced to "~/.openclaw/skills/running-sdlc/"

  Scenario: Gateway is restarted after sync
    Given the OpenClaw skill is synced
    When the sync completes
    Then the OpenClaw gateway is restarted
