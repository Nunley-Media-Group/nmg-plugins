Feature: Writing Specs Skill
  As a developer working on a GitHub issue
  I want an automated 3-phase specification process
  So that implementation is guided by well-structured BDD specs

  # --- Happy Path ---

  Scenario: Requirements spec captures issue intent
    Given I invoke "/writing-specs" with a GitHub issue reference
    When Phase 1 completes
    Then a requirements spec is created in ".claude/specs/{feature-name}/"
    And it contains acceptance criteria from the issue

  Scenario: Design spec defines technical approach
    Given the requirements spec has been reviewed and approved
    When Phase 2 completes
    Then a design spec is created with architecture decisions and component design

  Scenario: Tasks spec provides implementation plan
    Given the design spec has been reviewed and approved
    When Phase 3 completes
    Then a tasks spec is created with ordered implementation tasks
    And a Gherkin feature file is created with BDD scenarios

  # --- Review Gates ---

  Scenario: Human review gates pause between phases
    Given I am not in automation mode
    When a phase completes
    Then the skill pauses for human review before proceeding

  # --- Naming ---

  Scenario: Feature name follows naming convention
    Given a GitHub issue with number 42 and title "Add user auth"
    When the feature name is derived
    Then it uses the format "42-add-user-auth"

  # --- Defect Handling ---

  Scenario: Bug issues use defect templates
    Given the GitHub issue has a "bug" label
    When the spec phases execute
    Then defect-focused templates are used
    And they include reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and flat task lists
