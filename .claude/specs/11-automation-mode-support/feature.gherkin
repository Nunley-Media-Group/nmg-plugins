Feature: Automation Mode Support
  As an automation platform operator
  I want all SDLC skills to detect a headless mode flag
  So that the full workflow can be driven by external agents without human intervention

  Scenario: Auto-mode flag enables headless operation
    Given ".claude/auto-mode" exists in the project
    When any SDLC skill is invoked
    Then it operates without interactive prompts or human review gates

  Scenario: Writing-specs skips human review gates
    Given automation mode is active
    When "/writing-specs" runs
    Then all 3 human review gates between phases are skipped automatically

  Scenario: Implementing-specs skips plan mode
    Given automation mode is active
    When "/implementing-specs" runs
    Then plan mode is skipped and implementation proceeds without approval

  Scenario: Creating-issues infers criteria
    Given automation mode is active
    When "/creating-issues" is invoked with a feature description
    Then it skips the interview and generates acceptance criteria from steering docs

  Scenario: Starting-issues auto-selects oldest
    Given automation mode is active
    When "/starting-issues" runs without an issue number argument
    Then it selects the oldest open issue automatically

  Scenario: Skills suppress next-step suggestions
    Given automation mode is active
    When any skill completes
    Then it outputs "Done. Awaiting orchestrator." instead of next-step suggestions
