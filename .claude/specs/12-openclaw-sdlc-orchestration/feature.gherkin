Feature: OpenClaw SDLC Orchestration
  As an OpenClaw agent operator
  I want a deterministic SDLC orchestrator
  So that the workflow runs reliably with step sequencing, validation, and Discord reporting

  Scenario: Full SDLC cycle runs end-to-end
    Given the runner is started with a valid config
    When it runs to completion
    Then it executes all SDLC steps from issue selection through merge

  Scenario: Steps have precondition validation
    Given the runner advances to a new step
    When preconditions for that step are checked
    Then the step only proceeds if all preconditions pass

  Scenario: Failed steps retry with escalation
    Given a step fails
    When retries are attempted
    Then the step retries up to its configured cap
    And escalation occurs if all retries are exhausted

  Scenario: Discord status updates at each step
    Given a Discord channel is configured
    When each step starts, completes, or fails
    Then a status message is posted to Discord

  Scenario: Resume detects in-progress work
    Given the runner starts on a feature branch with existing work
    When it inspects git state
    Then it hydrates state from reality and resumes from the correct step

  Scenario: Auto-commit after implementation
    Given implementation completes with uncommitted changes
    When the step finishes
    Then the runner auto-commits and pushes
