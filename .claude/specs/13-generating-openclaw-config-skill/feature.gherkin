Feature: Generating OpenClaw Config Skill
  As a developer setting up OpenClaw automation
  I want a skill that generates a project-specific SDLC runner config
  So that I can configure per-step settings without manually writing JSON

  Scenario: Config file is generated for the project
    Given I invoke "/generating-openclaw-config" in a project
    When the skill completes
    Then an "sdlc-config.json" file is written to the project root

  Scenario: Config includes per-step settings
    Given the config is generated
    When I inspect "sdlc-config.json"
    Then each SDLC step has maxTurns, timeout, and skill reference fields

  Scenario: Gitignore is updated
    Given the config is generated
    When I inspect ".gitignore"
    Then "sdlc-config.json" and ".claude/sdlc-state.json" are listed

  Scenario: Skill is available in all nmg-sdlc projects
    Given nmg-sdlc is installed in a project
    When I list available skills
    Then "/generating-openclaw-config" appears as available
