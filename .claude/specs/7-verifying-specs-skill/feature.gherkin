Feature: Verifying Specs Skill
  As a developer who has implemented a feature
  I want automated verification that my implementation matches the spec
  So that I can catch spec drift and architectural problems before opening a PR

  # --- Happy Path ---

  Scenario: Implementation is verified against spec
    Given I invoke "/verifying-specs" for a completed feature
    When verification runs
    Then each acceptance criterion from the spec is checked against the implementation
    And each is marked as Pass or Fail with file path evidence

  Scenario: Architecture review evaluates quality
    Given spec verification is complete
    When the architecture review runs
    Then the architecture-reviewer agent evaluates SOLID, security, performance, testability, and error handling
    And scores are returned on a 1-5 scale

  # --- Auto-Fix ---

  Scenario: Findings are fixed during verification
    Given findings are discovered during verification
    When a finding requires fewer than 20 lines to fix
    Then the skill fixes it, runs tests, and re-verifies
    And larger findings are deferred with documentation

  # --- GitHub Integration ---

  Scenario: GitHub issue is updated with evidence
    Given verification is complete
    When the report is generated
    Then the GitHub issue is updated with a comment containing verification results

  # --- Bug Fix ---

  Scenario: Bug fix verification checks regression
    Given the feature is a bug fix
    When verification runs
    Then it checks reproduction and validates regression scenarios
    And it audits blast radius and confirms minimal change scope
