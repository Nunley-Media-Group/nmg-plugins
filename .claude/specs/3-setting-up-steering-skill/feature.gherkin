Feature: Setting Up Steering Skill
  As a developer adopting the nmg-sdlc workflow
  I want an automated skill that scans my codebase and generates steering documents
  So that all subsequent SDLC skills have the context they need

  # --- Happy Path ---

  Scenario: Steering documents are generated
    Given I invoke "/setting-up-steering" in a project without existing steering docs
    When the skill completes its codebase scan
    Then "product.md", "tech.md", and "structure.md" are created in ".claude/steering/"

  # --- Document Content ---

  Scenario: Product steering captures domain context
    Given the skill has scanned the codebase
    When I review "product.md"
    Then it contains the product's purpose, target users, and key capabilities

  Scenario: Tech steering captures architecture
    Given the skill has scanned the codebase
    When I review "tech.md"
    Then it contains the tech stack, frameworks, conventions, and architectural patterns

  Scenario: Structure steering captures layout
    Given the skill has scanned the codebase
    When I review "structure.md"
    Then it contains the directory structure, key file locations, and module organization
