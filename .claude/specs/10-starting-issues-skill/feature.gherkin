Feature: Starting Issues Skill
  As a developer ready to begin work on a feature
  I want a skill that selects an issue, creates a branch, and sets it to In Progress
  So that I can start development with proper branch hygiene and issue tracking

  Scenario: Issue selection presents open issues
    Given I invoke "/starting-issues" in interactive mode
    When the skill starts
    Then it lists open GitHub issues for me to select from

  Scenario: Feature branch is created and linked
    Given I select a GitHub issue
    When branch setup completes
    Then a feature branch is created and linked to the issue via "gh issue develop"

  Scenario: Issue status is updated
    Given a feature branch is created
    When the issue is linked
    Then the issue status is set to "In Progress" in any associated GitHub Project

  Scenario: Automation mode auto-selects oldest issue
    Given automation mode is active
    When "/starting-issues" runs
    Then it selects the oldest open issue without user confirmation

  Scenario: Issue number can be provided as argument
    Given I invoke "/starting-issues" with an issue number
    When the skill runs
    Then it skips issue selection and uses the provided issue number directly
