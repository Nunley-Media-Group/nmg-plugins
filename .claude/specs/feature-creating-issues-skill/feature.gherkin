Feature: Creating Issues Skill
  As a developer or product owner
  I want a guided interview process that produces well-groomed GitHub issues
  So that every feature request is captured in a structured, spec-ready format

  # --- Happy Path ---

  Scenario: Interactive interview gathers requirements
    Given I invoke "/creating-issues" without automation mode
    When the skill starts
    Then it asks adaptive questions about the feature need
    And it skips topics I've already addressed

  Scenario: Issue body follows BDD template
    Given the interview is complete
    When the GitHub issue is created
    Then the body contains User Story, Background, Acceptance Criteria, Functional Requirements, and Out of Scope sections
    And acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format

  # --- Bug Report ---

  Scenario: Bug report uses defect template
    Given I'm creating an issue for a bug
    When I indicate it's a defect
    Then the issue uses the bug report template
    And it includes reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, and environment table

  # --- Automation Mode ---

  Scenario: Automation mode skips interview
    Given automation mode is active with ".claude/auto-mode" file present
    When I invoke "/creating-issues" with a feature description argument
    Then the skill skips the interview
    And it infers 3-5 acceptance criteria from steering docs
