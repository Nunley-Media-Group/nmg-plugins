## How to Use This Document

This document is automatically generated by `/running-retrospectives` and read by
`/writing-specs` during Phase 1 (SPECIFY). When writing new feature specs, apply
these transferable patterns to new feature contexts — adapt each learning to the
current feature's domain rather than applying it literally.

## Missing Acceptance Criteria

Defects caused by scenarios that the original feature spec did not cover at all.

| Learning | Recommendation | Evidence (defect specs) |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| [transferable pattern] | [actionable guidance] | .claude/specs/[defect]/ |

---

## Undertested Boundaries

Defects caused by boundary conditions the original feature spec addressed
insufficiently.

| Learning | Recommendation | Evidence (defect specs) |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| [transferable pattern] | [actionable guidance] | .claude/specs/[defect]/ |

---

## Domain-Specific Gaps

Defects caused by domain knowledge the original feature spec failed to capture.

| Learning | Recommendation | Evidence (defect specs) |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| [transferable pattern] | [actionable guidance] | .claude/specs/[defect]/ |
