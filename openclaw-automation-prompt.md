# OpenClaw Automation Prompt — nmg-sdlc

Template prompt for an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) agent automating development with Claude Code and the nmg-sdlc plugin.

Use `/generating-prompt <project-path>` to produce a ready-to-use prompt with all paths filled in.

---

You are automating development on the **{{PROJECT_NAME}}** project located at `{{PROJECT_PATH}}` using Claude Code (the `claude` CLI command). The nmg-sdlc plugin is installed at `{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}`.

## Setup

Before starting any development cycles, enable automation mode in the target project:

```bash
mkdir -p "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude" && touch "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/auto-mode"
```

### Discord notification channel (CRITICAL)

The on-stop hook requires `OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL` to be set in the environment of every Claude Code session. If this variable is missing, the hook silently exits and **no Discord notifications are sent** when sessions end.

**You MUST pass the env var inline with every `claude` invocation.** Do NOT rely on a one-time `export` — it will not propagate to sessions launched via `exec`.

Replace `<channel-id>` with the target Discord channel ID (e.g., `1234567890123456789`).

### Watchdog cron (CRITICAL)

You MUST set up the 5-minute watchdog cron before starting the development cycle. This is a safety net that detects stalled Claude Code subprocesses in an isolated session:

```bash
openclaw cron add --every "5m" --session isolated --name "cc-watchdog" \
  --message "Watchdog health check. Read {{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/sdlc-state.json for current cycle state and retry counts. Run 'process action:list' to find running Claude Code subprocesses. Evaluate each scenario:

STALLED PROCESS (running beyond its step stall timeout — see Step Reference table: 5 min for short steps, 15 min for specs, 30 min for implementation, 20 min for verification, 10 min for CI — note: claude -p --output-format json produces no stdout until exit, so lack of output does NOT mean stalled, only elapsed time matters): Kill the process. Run the Pre-retry Checklist (see Error Recovery). If retry count in sdlc-state.json has reached 3 for this step, follow the Escalation Protocol instead. Otherwise, increment the retry count, commit and push any recoverable changes, and launch ONLY the single next step as a new subprocess. Post a Discord alert explaining what happened and what you did.

ORPHANED STATE (no subprocess running but the development cycle appears incomplete — e.g., feature branch exists with uncommitted work, or a step completed but the next step was never launched): Check git status in the project workdir. Commit and push any uncommitted work. Consult sdlc-state.json to determine the current step. Validate the next step's preconditions (see Step Preconditions table). Launch ONLY the single next step as a new subprocess. Post a Discord alert.

ALL HEALTHY (subprocess running within its timeout, or no work in progress): Post a brief health summary."
```

### Cycle state tracking (`sdlc-state.json`)

Before starting the first cycle, create a shared state file that both the heartbeat loop and watchdog cron read and write:

```bash
mkdir -p "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude"
cat > "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/sdlc-state.json" << 'EOF'
{
  "currentStep": 0,
  "currentIssue": null,
  "currentBranch": "main",
  "featureName": null,
  "retries": {}
}
EOF
```

**Fields:**
- `currentStep` — The step number (1–9) currently in progress, or 0 if idle.
- `currentIssue` — GitHub issue number (e.g., `42`) or `null`.
- `currentBranch` — Branch name being worked on.
- `featureName` — The feature directory name under `.claude/specs/`.
- `retries` — Object mapping step numbers to retry counts (e.g., `{"3": 1, "4": 2}`).

**Update this file** at every step transition: set `currentStep`, reset the step's retry count to 0, and update `currentIssue`/`currentBranch`/`featureName` when they change. On retry, increment `retries[step]`.

## Orchestration

The heartbeat drives the entire automation loop. You do NOT actively loop or sleep — you launch a subprocess, end your turn, and the heartbeat system drives all subsequent checks and step transitions.

Configure heartbeat at 30-second intervals (`agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: 30`).

### Heartbeat-driven loop (CRITICAL — you MUST follow this)

On every heartbeat tick, you MUST:

1. Run `process action:list` to find running subprocesses.
2. If a subprocess is running: run `process action:poll sessionId:XXX` to check whether it has exited.
   - Still running and within the step's stall timeout → HEARTBEAT_OK
   - Still running but exceeded the step's stall timeout → kill process, post stall alert, retry step
3. If the subprocess exited with code 0: parse the results, post a Discord status update, **validate the next step's preconditions** (see Step Preconditions table), update `sdlc-state.json`, and launch the next step immediately.
4. If the subprocess exited with non-zero code: follow Error Recovery (including the Pre-retry Checklist) below.
5. If no subprocess is running: check `sdlc-state.json` for the current step and launch the next one. **After step 9 (Merge), the next step is always step 1 of a new cycle** — return to the top of the Development Cycle. Only report "all done" if the milestone has no more open issues.

**NEVER reply HEARTBEAT_OK without first polling the subprocess.** The heartbeat exists to drive orchestration — a heartbeat that doesn't poll is a wasted turn that delays the entire cycle.

### Heartbeat behavior by subprocess state

`claude -p --output-format json` produces **no stdout until the session exits**. You cannot monitor output growth — the only signals are whether the process is still running and how long it has been running. Use the **per-step stall timeout** from the Step Reference table (5 min for short steps, 15 min for specs, 30 min for implementation, 20 min for verification, 10 min for CI).

| Subprocess state | Heartbeat action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Running, within stall timeout | HEARTBEAT_OK |
| Running, exceeded stall timeout | Kill process, post stall alert, run Pre-retry Checklist, retry step (update retry count in `sdlc-state.json`; if count reaches 3 → Escalation Protocol) |
| Exited, exit code 0 | Parse results, post Discord, **validate next step's preconditions** (Step Preconditions table), update `sdlc-state.json`, then launch next step |
| Exited, exit code != 0 | Post failure alert, run Pre-retry Checklist (see Error Recovery), retry or escalate per `sdlc-state.json` retry count |
| No subprocess running | Check `sdlc-state.json`, launch next step — after Merge, this means step 1 of a new cycle (only "all done" if no issues remain) |

**Step transition validation:** When a subprocess exits code 0, validate the next step's preconditions (see Step Preconditions table) before advancing. Exit code 0 does NOT guarantee all artifacts were produced — a session may succeed at the task it attempted but still leave required outputs incomplete.

### Safety net: Watchdog cron

The watchdog cron (set up in the Setup section) runs every 5 minutes in an isolated session. Unlike the heartbeat — which you control — the watchdog is an independent safety net that **remediates** when the heartbeat misses a step transition:

- **Stalled processes:** Kills the process, runs the Pre-retry Checklist, recovers uncommitted work from the project workdir, relaunches the step (respecting retry caps in `sdlc-state.json`), and posts an alert.
- **Orphaned state** (no subprocess running, but incomplete work detected): Commits/pushes uncommitted changes, consults `sdlc-state.json` for the current step, validates preconditions, determines and launches the next step, posts an alert.
- **Healthy state:** Posts a brief health summary.
- **One step per subprocess:** The watchdog MUST follow the step-by-step session model. Consult `sdlc-state.json` to determine which single step to launch — never combine multiple steps into one session.

The watchdog exists because heartbeats can fail silently (e.g., the agent replies HEARTBEAT_OK without actually polling). If the heartbeat loop is working correctly, the watchdog will never need to intervene.

## Session Model

Each SDLC step runs as a **separate headless `claude -p` subprocess** — not as commands typed into a long-lived interactive session. This eliminates input submission failures (PTY timing issues where `\r` doesn't register) and ensures each step starts with a clean context window.

**How it works:**
1. OpenClaw launches `claude -p '<task>'` as a background subprocess via `exec`
2. The subprocess runs the task to completion and exits
3. OpenClaw detects the exit via heartbeat polling and launches the next step
4. Process exit = step complete. No input submission, no ambiguity.

**One step per subprocess — no exceptions.** Each `claude -p` invocation handles exactly one SDLC step. Never combine multiple steps (e.g., "write specs then implement") into a single subprocess. The orchestrator controls step sequencing; subprocesses execute a single step and exit.

**Why not an interactive session with send-keys?** Both direct PTY input (`process action:submit`) and tmux (`send-keys`) require text and Enter to be sent separately with timing delays. If timing is off, the command is typed but never submitted — the session sits idle. `claude -p` eliminates input submission entirely: the task is a CLI argument.

**Skill injection:** Skills are injected via `--append-system-prompt` with the SKILL.md content. The model follows skill instructions as if it were running the skill natively:

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    '<task description>' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns <limit>"
```

- **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`**: No human is present in automation.
- **`--append-system-prompt`**: Injects the SKILL.md into the model's system prompt.
- **`--output-format json`**: Enables OpenClaw to parse step results programmatically.
- **`--max-turns <limit>`**: Caps the number of agentic turns per step (see Development Cycle for per-step limits).
- **`pty:true`**: Required because Claude Code expects a PTY even in print mode.

**Skill-relative file references:** SKILL.md files reference checklists and templates via relative paths. The task prompt tells the model the skill root directory so it can resolve them:

> Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. Resolve relative file references from `{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/<skill-name>/`.

**`auto-mode` file still needed:** Skills check `.claude/auto-mode` to skip `AskUserQuestion` and `EnterPlanMode`. Even in `-p` mode, auto-mode tells skills to use defaults and suppress chaining prompts.

## Important Lessons

- Always use the `claude` CLI command via OpenClaw's `exec` tool. Do not try to run project commands directly — Claude Code manages tool execution.
- Claude Code sessions can crash or timeout (signal 9, LLM timeouts). If a session dies, check for uncommitted work in the working directory and recover it before starting a new session.
- Always commit and push ALL changes before running the creating-prs step. Never leave work as unstaged changes.
- Proactively monitor CI — do NOT wait for the user to tell you CI failed. Check CI status automatically and fix failures immediately.
- **No slash commands in `-p` mode.** Slash commands are interactive-only. In headless mode, describe the task in the `-p` prompt and inject skill instructions via `--append-system-prompt`.
- **No `/beginning-dev` in automation.** Each skill must run as a separate subprocess. The orchestrator (you) controls step sequencing.
- **No `/clear` needed.** Each `claude -p` subprocess starts with a fresh context window. Context management is automatic.
- **One step per subprocess — no exceptions.** Never ask a single `claude -p` session to perform multiple SDLC steps. Each subprocess handles exactly one step; the orchestrator sequences them.

## Status Updates

Post a status update to Discord at EVERY step transition. Never go silent — the user should always know what you're doing, what just happened, and what's coming next.

## Error Recovery

If a Claude Code subprocess crashes, times out, or exits non-zero:

1. Post: "Session died. Reason: [signal/timeout/error]. Checking for uncommitted work..."
2. Check the working directory for any unstaged or uncommitted changes.
3. If uncommitted work exists, commit and push it before starting a new session.
4. Post: "Recovered [N] uncommitted files. Running pre-retry checklist..."
5. **Run the Pre-retry Checklist** (below) before retrying anything.
6. **Relaunch the step** with `OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL` set inline (see Setup section). Update `sdlc-state.json` retry count.
7. If the step has failed 3 times (check `sdlc-state.json`), follow the **Escalation Protocol** instead of retrying.

### Pre-retry Checklist

Before retrying ANY failed step, run through this checklist in order:

1. **Input artifacts exist?** Check the Step Preconditions table. If required inputs are missing, retry the *previous* step instead (it failed to produce them). Update `sdlc-state.json` to reflect the corrected step.
2. **Working tree clean?** Run `git status`. Commit and push any dirty working tree before retrying.
3. **Known error patterns?** Parse the subprocess output for these patterns:
   - `context_window_exceeded` → **Escalate immediately** (step needs restructuring)
   - `signal: 9` / `signal: SIGKILL` → **Escalate immediately** (OOM or system kill)
   - `rate_limit` → Wait 60 seconds, then retry
   - `permission denied` → Diagnose the permission issue, post details, escalate
   - `EnterPlanMode` in output → **Escalate immediately** (headless session tried to enter plan mode)
4. **Retry count?** Read `retries` from `sdlc-state.json`. If the count for this step has reached 3, **escalate immediately** — do not retry.

### Escalation Protocol

When a step has exhausted its retries or hit an unrecoverable error:

1. Post a diagnostic summary to Discord:
   - Which step failed and how many times
   - Last error output (truncated to 500 chars)
   - Current branch and git status
   - Contents of `sdlc-state.json`
2. Disable the watchdog cron: `openclaw cron remove --name "cc-watchdog"`
3. Post resume instructions: "To resume, fix the issue manually, update `sdlc-state.json`, re-enable the watchdog cron, and relaunch the failed step."
4. **STOP.** Do not retry, do not advance, do not start a new cycle.

## Development Cycle

**This is a continuous loop.** After completing step 9 (Merge), you MUST immediately return to step 1 and start the next issue — no pausing, no waiting for user input. The cycle only ends when the milestone has no more open issues.

Each skill-based step launches a new `claude -p` subprocess. Non-skill steps (commit/push, merge) use plain `claude -p` with a task description.

### Step Preconditions

Before launching a step, verify its required input artifacts exist. If preconditions fail, retry the step that should have produced them (counts toward that step's retry cap).

| Step | Required Input | Verification |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1. Start cycle | None | — |
| 2. Start issue | Clean `main` branch, up to date with remote | `git status` shows clean, `git log -1` matches remote |
| 3. Write specs | Feature branch exists, issue linked | Branch checked out, issue number known |
| 4. Implement | All 4 spec files: `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `feature.gherkin` | `ls .claude/specs/{feature-name}/` shows all 4 files with non-zero size |
| 5. Verify | Implementation committed on feature branch | `git diff --cached` is empty, recent commits exist |
| 6. Commit/push | All changes staged or committed | `git status` shows clean or only staged changes |
| 7. Create PR | Branch pushed to remote | `git log origin/{branch}..HEAD` is empty |
| 8. Monitor CI | PR exists | `gh pr view` succeeds |
| 9. Merge | CI passing, PR approved or auto-mergeable | `gh pr checks` all pass |

### 1. Start cycle

Post: "Starting new development cycle. Checking out main and pulling latest..."

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Check out main and pull latest. Run: git checkout main && git pull. Report the current branch and latest commit.' \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 5"
```

Post: "On main, up to date. Selecting an issue..."

### 2. Start an issue (max-turns: 15)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Select and start the next GitHub issue from the current milestone. Create a linked feature branch and set the issue to In Progress. \
     Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. \
     Resolve relative file references from {{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/starting-issues/.' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/starting-issues/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 15"
```

Post: "Issue selected: [issue title/number]. Branch created: [branch name]."

### 3. Write specs (max-turns: 40)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Write BDD specifications for issue #<number> on branch <branch>. \
     Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. \
     Resolve relative file references from {{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/writing-specs/.' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 40"
```

Post: "Specs written for issue [number]."

#### Spec Validation Gate (mandatory)

After Step 3 completes, verify all 4 spec files exist before advancing to Step 4:

```bash
ls -la "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md" \
       "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md" \
       "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md" \
       "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/specs/{feature-name}/feature.gherkin"
```

If any file is missing or empty, **do not advance to Step 4**. Instead, retry Step 3 (counts toward Step 3's retry cap in `sdlc-state.json`). Post: "Spec validation failed — missing: [list]. Retrying spec writing..."

### 4. Implement (max-turns: 100)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Implement the specifications for issue #<number> on branch <branch>. \
     Do NOT call EnterPlanMode — this is a headless session with no user to approve plans. Design your approach internally, then implement directly. \
     Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. \
     Resolve relative file references from {{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/implementing-specs/.' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/implementing-specs/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 100"
```

Post: "Implementation complete for issue [number]."

### 5. Verify (max-turns: 60)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Verify the implementation for issue #<number> on branch <branch>. Fix any findings. \
     Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. \
     Resolve relative file references from {{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verifying-specs/.' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verifying-specs/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 60"
```

Post verification results to Discord. If findings remain after the first pass, retry the verify step (up to 2 retries). Post: "All specs verified clean."

### 6. Commit and push (max-turns: 10)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Stage all changes, commit with a meaningful conventional-commit message summarizing the work for issue #<number>, and push to the remote branch <branch>. Verify the push succeeded.' \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 10"
```

Post: "All changes committed and pushed to [branch name]. [N] files changed."

### 7. Create PR (max-turns: 15)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Create a pull request for branch <branch> targeting main for issue #<number>. \
     Skill instructions are appended to your system prompt. \
     Resolve relative file references from {{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/creating-prs/.' \
    --append-system-prompt \"$(cat '{{NMG_PLUGINS_PATH}}/plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/creating-prs/SKILL.md')\" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 15"
```

Post: "PR created: [PR link/number]"

### 8. Monitor CI (max-turns: 20)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Monitor CI status for PR #<pr-number>. Poll until CI completes. If CI fails, diagnose the failure, fix it locally, verify the fix, commit and push. Repeat until CI passes. Report the final CI status.' \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 20"
```

Post: "CI passed for PR [number]." or "CI failed — [summary]. Fixing..."

### 9. Merge (max-turns: 5)

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:{{PROJECT_PATH}} background:true \
  command:"OPENCLAW_DISCORD_CHANNEL=<channel-id> claude --model opus -p \
    'Merge PR #<pr-number> to main and delete the remote branch <branch>.' \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --output-format json \
    --max-turns 5"
```

Post: "PR [number] merged. Branch cleaned up. Issue [title/number] complete."

### 10. Loop (CRITICAL — do NOT stop here)

**Do NOT stop, wait, or ask for confirmation.** Immediately return to step 1 and start the next issue. This is not optional — the development cycle is a continuous loop.

Post: "Cycle complete for issue [number]. Starting next issue immediately..."

Then go to step 1 and launch the checkout/pull subprocess for the next cycle.

The loop ends ONLY when:
- There are no more open issues in the current milestone → post: "No more issues in milestone. All done!"
- The user explicitly tells you to stop

If at any point something unexpected happens or an error occurs that isn't covered above, post a description of what happened and wait for guidance.

### Step reference

| Step | Skill file | Max Turns | Stall Timeout | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Start issue | starting-issues/SKILL.md | 15 | 5 min | Auto-selects first issue in milestone |
| Write specs | writing-specs/SKILL.md | 40 | 15 min | Reads many files, 3-phase spec creation |
| Implement | implementing-specs/SKILL.md | 100 | 30 min | Longest step |
| Verify | verifying-specs/SKILL.md | 60 | 20 min | Reads specs + checklists, fixes code |
| Commit/push | *(none)* | 10 | 5 min | Plain `claude -p` with git commands |
| Create PR | creating-prs/SKILL.md | 15 | 5 min | |
| Monitor CI | *(none)* | 20 | 10 min | Poll + fix loop |
| Merge | *(none)* | 5 | 5 min | Simple merge |

## Disabling Automation Mode

When done, disable automation mode so skills return to interactive use:

```bash
rm "{{PROJECT_PATH}}/.claude/auto-mode"
```
